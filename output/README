# Predict the total travel time of taxi trips based on their initial partial trajectories

This is the second of two data science challenges that share the same dataset. The Taxi Service Trajectory competition predicts the final destination of taxi trips. 



To improve the efficiency of electronic taxi dispatching systems it is important to be able to predict how long a driver will have his taxi occupied. If a dispatcher knew approximately when a taxi driver would be ending their current ride, they would be better able to identify which driver to assign to each pickup request. 

In this challenge, we ask you to build a predictive framework that is able to infer the trip time of taxi rides in Porto, Portugal based on their (initial) partial trajectories. The output of such a framework must be the travel time of a particular taxi trip.

This competition is affiliated with the organization of ECML/PKDD 2015.
